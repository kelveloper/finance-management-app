# Lessons Learned

This document serves as a reference for successful debugging efforts and solutions to technical challenges encountered during development.

---

## 1. Backend Fails to Start Due to Missing Build

**Date:** December 2024

### The Problem
Backend server wouldn't start because the TypeScript files weren't compiled to JavaScript.

### Solution
- Always run `npm run build` in the backend directory before starting the server
- Use `npm run dev` for development with auto-compilation
- Check that the `dist/` directory exists after building

---

## 2. Jest Cannot Handle External Module Imports in React Native

**Date:** January 2025

### The Problem
Jest with `jest-expo` preset throws "You are trying to import a file outside of the scope of the test code" when importing from directories like `common/`, `backend/`, or `utils/` from within the `app/` directory.

### Root Cause
The `jest-expo` preset has fundamental limitations that prevent importing modules from outside the `app/` directory, even with custom `moduleNameMapper` configurations.

### Solution
**Replace Jest with Vitest for frontend testing:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev react-native-testing-mocks vitest @vitest/ui jsdom @testing-library/jest-dom
   ```

2. **Create `vitest.config.ts`:**
   ```javascript
   import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
   import { reactNativeVitestPlugin } from 'react-native-testing-mocks/vitest';

   export default defineConfig({
     plugins: [reactNativeVitestPlugin()],
     test: {
       include: ['app/**/*.test.tsx', 'utils/**/*.test.ts', 'hooks/**/*.test.ts'],
       exclude: ['node_modules/**', 'backend/**'],
       setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'],
       environment: 'jsdom',
       globals: true,
     },
     resolve: {
       alias: {
         '@/common': './common',
         '@/utils': './utils',
         '@/hooks': './hooks',
         '@/app': './app',
       },
     },
   });
   ```

3. **Create `vitest.setup.ts`:**
   ```javascript
   import 'react-native-testing-mocks/register';
   import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
   // Add necessary mocks for React Native modules
   ```

4. **Add Scripts to `package.json`:**
   ```json
   {
     "scripts": {
       "test:vitest": "vitest",
       "test:vitest:ui": "vitest --ui"
     }
   }
   ```

### Key Benefits
- ✅ External imports work seamlessly
- ✅ 6x faster than babel-jest
- ✅ Compatible with React Native Testing Library
- ✅ No more "outside scope" errors
- ✅ Better developer experience

### Migration Strategy
- Keep Jest for backend tests (working fine)
- Use Vitest for all frontend tests
- Both frameworks can coexist during transition

## 3. Missing App Startup in Backend Server

**Date:** January 2025

### The Problem
Backend API returning 404 errors because `app.listen()` was missing from the compiled code.

### Root Cause
The server startup code was accidentally removed during editing.

### Solution
Always ensure the backend `index.ts` file ends with:
```javascript
app.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', () => {
  console.log(`Backend server is running on http://0.0.0.0:${port}`);
});
```

---

## 4. Persistent EPERM Errors Blocking npm Scripts

**Date:** January 2025

### The Problem: `EPERM: operation not permitted, uv_cwd` Error

During manual testing, the backend server consistently failed to start using `npm run dev` or `npm run start` commands, throwing `EPERM: operation not permitted, uv_cwd` errors. This prevented us from running the application for manual testing.

### Root Cause & Solutions

**Root Cause:** File system permission issues with the Node.js/npm installation on the user's system.

**Immediate Workaround:**
1. **Clear npm cache:** `npm cache clean --force`
2. **Build manually:** `cd backend && npm run build`
3. **Run compiled code directly:** `node backend/dist/index.js`

**Key Insight:** When npm scripts fail due to permission issues, bypass them by running the underlying commands directly. Always ensure you're running the compiled JavaScript files, not the TypeScript source files.

---

## 5. API Endpoint Mismatch Between Frontend and Backend

**Date:** January 2025

### The Problem: Frontend 404 Errors During Data Fetching

The frontend was successfully connecting to the backend server but receiving 404 errors when fetching transaction data.

### Root Cause & Solution

**Root Cause:** The frontend was calling `/api/data` but the backend only had `/api/transactions` endpoint.

**Solution:** Updated the backend endpoint in `backend/src/index.ts`:
```javascript
// Before (causing 404)
app.get('/api/transactions', ...)

// After (working) 
app.get('/api/data', ...)
```

**Debugging Method:** Used `curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/data` to test the backend endpoint directly and confirm it was working.

**Key Insight:** When debugging API issues, always test endpoints directly with tools like `curl` to isolate whether the problem is frontend or backend related.

## 5.1. React Native Web Shadow Style Deprecation

**Date:** January 2025

### The Problem: Shadow Style Deprecation Warnings

Console warnings appeared about deprecated shadow style properties: `"shadow*" style props are deprecated. Use "boxShadow".`

### Root Cause & Solution

**Root Cause:** React Native Web deprecated individual shadow properties (`shadowColor`, `shadowOffset`, `shadowOpacity`, `shadowRadius`) in favor of the CSS `boxShadow` property.

**Solution:** Updated styles to use platform-specific shadow handling in `app/onboarding/bank-linking.tsx`:
```javascript
// Before (causing warnings)
button: {
  shadowColor: '#000',
  shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 4 },
  shadowOpacity: 0.3,
  shadowRadius: 5,
  elevation: 5,
}

// After (no warnings)
button: {
  ...Platform.select({
    web: {
      boxShadow: '0px 4px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3)',
    },
    default: {
      shadowColor: '#000',
      shadowOffset: { width: 0, height: 4 },
      shadowOpacity: 0.3,
      shadowRadius: 5,
      elevation: 5,
    },
  }),
}
```

**Key Insight:** When building cross-platform React Native apps (mobile + web), use `Platform.select()` to provide platform-specific styles for features that have different implementations across platforms.

---

## 6. React Query Context Missing in Frontend

**Date:** January 2025

### The Problem: `No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one`

The frontend application was crashing because React Query hooks were being used without the proper context provider.

### Root Cause & Solution

**Root Cause:** The application wasn't wrapped with `QueryClientProvider` at the root level.

**Solution:** Updated `app/_layout.tsx`:
```javascript
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from '@tanstack/react-query';

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

export default function RootLayout() {
  return (
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <SessionProvider>
        {/* rest of app */}
      </SessionProvider>
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

**Key Insight:** Always ensure React context providers are properly set up at the application root when using libraries that depend on context.

```javascript
// Debt sequence calculation with payment acceleration
const calculateDebtSequence = (sortedDebts, extraAmount) => {
  let remainingExtra = extraAmount;
  const results = [];
  let cumulativeMonths = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < sortedDebts.length; i++) {
    const debt = sortedDebts[i];
    const payment = debt.minPayment + (i === 0 ? remainingExtra : 0);
    const months = calculateDebtPayoffMonths(debt.balance, payment, debt.interestRate);
    
    results.push({
      ...debt,
      payment,
      months: cumulativeMonths + months,
      totalInterest: calculateTotalInterest(debt.balance, payment, debt.interestRate)
    });

    // Payment acceleration: add paid-off debt's minimum to next debt
    if (i < sortedDebts.length - 1) {
      remainingExtra += debt.minPayment;
    }
    
    cumulativeMonths += months;
  }

  return results;
};
```

**Strategy Comparison Logic:**
```javascript
// Three-way strategy comparison
const calculateStrategyResults = (extraAmount) => {
  const currentResults = mockDebts.map(debt => ({
    ...debt,
    payment: debt.minPayment + (extraAmount / mockDebts.length), // Equal distribution
    months: calculateDebtPayoffMonths(debt.balance, debt.minPayment + (extraAmount / mockDebts.length), debt.interestRate),
    totalInterest: calculateTotalInterest(debt.balance, debt.minPayment + (extraAmount / mockDebts.length), debt.interestRate)
  }));

  const snowballDebts = [...mockDebts].sort((a, b) => a.balance - b.balance);
  const avalancheDebts = [...mockDebts].sort((a, b) => b.interestRate - a.interestRate);

  return {
    current: { debts: currentResults, totals: calculateTotals(currentResults) },
    snowball: { debts: calculateDebtSequence(snowballDebts, extraAmount), totals: calculateTotals(snowballResults) },
    avalanche: { debts: calculateDebtSequence(avalancheDebts, extraAmount), totals: calculateTotals(avalancheResults) }
  };
};
```

**Intelligent Recommendation System:**
```javascript
// AI-powered strategy recommendation
const recommendation = results.avalanche.totals.totalInterest <= results.snowball.totals.totalInterest
  ? `The Avalanche method saves you ${formatCurrency(results.snowball.totals.totalInterest - results.avalanche.totals.totalInterest)} more in interest vs Snowball, making it the most cost-effective approach.`
  : `The Snowball method provides psychological wins by paying off debts faster, which can help you stay motivated despite paying ${formatCurrency(results.avalanche.totals.totalInterest - results.snowball.totals.totalInterest)} more in interest.`;
```

## 11. Security Enhancement: Private Data Isolation

**Date:** January 12, 2025

### Security Improvement: CSV Data Protection

**Problem Identified:** The Chase CSV file containing real financial transaction data was stored in the public `backend/src/data/` directory, making it vulnerable to accidental exposure through version control.

**Solution Implemented:**
1. **Created Private Environment Directory:** Established `env/` folder specifically for sensitive data files
2. **Updated .gitignore:** Added `env/` to .gitignore to ensure it's never committed to version control
3. **Updated Code References:** Modified `backend/src/sync-chase-csv.ts` to reference the new secure path
4. **Added Documentation:** Created `env/README.md` with security guidelines and usage instructions

**Code Changes:**
```javascript
// Before: Public directory (security risk)
const filePath = path.join(__dirname, 'data', 'Chase8793_Activity_2025-2YRS.csv');

// After: Private environment directory (secure)
const filePath = path.join(__dirname, '..', '..', 'env', 'Chase8793_Activity_2025-2YRS.csv');
```

**Security Benefits:**
- **Zero Risk of Data Exposure:** CSV files can never be accidentally committed to git
- **Clear Separation:** Distinct boundary between public code and private data
- **Development Safety:** Developers can work with sample data without security concerns
- **Production Readiness:** Pattern established for secure data handling in production

**Best Practices Established:**
- Never store real financial data in tracked directories
- Use environment-specific folders for sensitive files
- Document security policies clearly
- Maintain separation between code and data

This security enhancement ensures that sensitive financial data remains protected throughout the development lifecycle while maintaining full application functionality.

## 3. Setting Up Staging Environment for Safe Deployment

**Date:** January 2025

### The Problem
Development → Production deployment without safety testing can break live apps for real users.

### Solution
**Create staging environment as production rehearsal:**

1. **Multiple Supabase Projects:**
   - Development: Daily coding with test data
   - Staging: Production-like testing with realistic data
   - Production: Live app for real users

2. **Environment-Specific Configuration:**
   ```bash
   # Development
   npm run dev                    # Uses .env.development
   
   # Staging  
   npm run dev:staging           # Uses .env.staging
   
   # Production
   npm run start:production      # Uses .env.production
   ```

3. **Safe Testing Workflow:**
   ```
   Code → Test Locally → Test on Staging → Deploy to Production
   ```

**Benefits Achieved:**
- **Risk Mitigation:** Never break production with untested changes
- **Stakeholder Preview:** Share features before public release
- **Deployment Confidence:** Test exact production environment
- **Cost Efficiency:** Staging uses free Supabase tier
- **Integration Testing:** Verify all services work together

**Implementation Files:**
- `docs/STAGING_SETUP.md` - Complete staging setup guide
- `docs/QUICK_STAGING_SETUP.md` - 5-minute quick start
- `backend/src/supabase.ts` - Environment-aware configuration
- `backend/package.json` - Environment-specific scripts

**Financial App Considerations:**
- Staging uses sandbox Plaid (safe bank simulation)
- Production uses real Plaid (actual bank connections)
- Separate databases prevent test data from affecting real users
- Environment isolation ensures compliance and security

## 5. Personalized AI Questionnaire System Implementation

**Date:** January 2025

### The Enhancement: Pre-Upload Personalization for Better AI Insights

Implemented a 3-question onboarding questionnaire that collects user preferences before data upload, enabling truly personalized AI coaching from day one.

### What We Built

#### 5.1 Interactive Questionnaire Flow
- **Progressive UI**: Beautiful step-by-step interface with progress indicators
- **3 Strategic Questions**: 
  - Financial personality (Planner, Goal-focused, Go-with-flow, Money-anxious)
  - Primary financial goal (Emergency fund, Major purchase, Wealth growth, etc.)
  - AI coaching style preference (Proactive alerts, Show patterns, Smart suggestions, Goal-focused)
- **Emoji-Enhanced Options**: Visual icons make choices more engaging and memorable

#### 5.2 Technical Implementation

**Frontend Components:**
```
app/onboarding/personalization.tsx - Interactive questionnaire screen
- Question navigation with back/next buttons
- Visual progress tracking (1 of 3, 2 of 3, etc.)
- Option selection with visual feedback
- Graceful error handling
```

**Backend API:**
```
POST /api/user/personalization - Secure endpoint with JWT authentication
- Validates user can only update their own profile
- Maps answers to personality scores and preferences
- Stores in user_profiles table for AI personalization
```

#### 5.3 Updated User Flow
**Before:** Auth → Bank Linking → Dashboard  
**After:** Auth → **Personalization Questions** → Bank Linking → Dashboard

#### 5.4 AI Personality Mapping
- **Planner** → Low impulse score (2/10), Long planning horizon
- **Goal-focused** → Medium impulse (4/10), Medium planning horizon  
- **Go-with-flow** → High impulse (7/10), Short planning horizon
- **Money-anxious** → Medium-high impulse (6/10), Short planning horizon

### Strategic Benefits

#### 5.5 Improved AI Insights
- **Day-One Personalization**: AI can provide relevant insights immediately
- **Coaching Style Matching**: Alerts vs. patterns vs. suggestions based on user preference
- **Goal-Oriented Analysis**: Focus insights around user's primary objective
- **Personality-Aware Advice**: Different advice for planners vs. go-with-flow users

#### 5.6 Better User Engagement
- **Sets Expectations**: Users understand the app will be personalized
- **Reduces Friction**: Shows value before requiring data upload
- **Foundation Building**: Prepares for post-upload validation questions

### Technical Decisions & Lessons

#### 5.7 UX Optimizations
- **No Success Alerts**: Removed unnecessary confirmation popups for smoother flow
- **Web-Compatible Alerts**: Created custom `showAlert()` function since React Native's `Alert.alert()` doesn't work on web
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues onboarding even if personalization API fails
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Collects baseline data pre-upload, can validate/refine post-upload

#### 5.8 Data Architecture
- **Secure Storage**: JWT-protected endpoint ensures users can only update their own profile
- **Structured Answers**: Stores raw answers in `learning_data.onboarding_answers` for future analysis
- **Smart Defaults**: Maps personality types to actionable AI preferences automatically

**Key Learning:** Pre-upload personalization strikes the perfect balance - gets valuable user context while they're motivated during onboarding, then can be refined with actual data analysis later.

## 6. Login Flow Fix: Proper Personalization Routing

**Date:** January 2025

### The Problem
After implementing the personalization questionnaire, users reported that when they logged in, they were seeing the CSV upload screen instead of the personalization questions. The system was skipping the personalization step for existing users.

### Root Cause Analysis
The backend login endpoint was only checking for transaction data (`hasData`) but not whether the user had completed the personalization questionnaire. The frontend routing logic was therefore incomplete:

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC LOGIC
if (isLogin) {
  router.replace(data.hasData ? '/(tabs)' : '/onboarding/bank-linking');
}
```

This meant users who logged in but hadn't completed personalization were sent directly to bank linking, bypassing the questionnaire entirely.

### Solution Implemented

#### 6.1 Backend Enhancement
Updated the login endpoint to check both transaction data AND personalization completion:

```javascript
// Check if user has completed personalization
const { data: userProfile, error: profileError } = await supabase
    .from('user_profiles')
    .select('id')
    .eq('id', user.id)
    .limit(1);

// Return both pieces of information
res.json({
    hasData: transactions && transactions.length > 0,
    hasCompletedPersonalization: userProfile && userProfile.length > 0
});
```

#### 6.2 Frontend Routing Logic
Updated the auth component to handle all possible user states:

```javascript
if (isLogin) {
  if (!data.hasCompletedPersonalization) {
    // User hasn't completed personalization - send them there first
    router.replace('/onboarding/personalization');
  } else if (!data.hasData) {
    // User completed personalization but has no transaction data
    router.replace('/onboarding/bank-linking');
  } else {
    // User has both personalization and transaction data
    router.replace('/(tabs)');
  }
}
```

### Complete User Flow Matrix

| User State | Personalization | Transaction Data | Route |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|--------|
| New User | ❌ | ❌ | `/onboarding/personalization` |
| Returning User | ❌ | ❌ | `/onboarding/personalization` |
| Returning User | ✅ | ❌ | `/onboarding/bank-linking` |
| Returning User | ✅ | ✅ | `/(tabs)` |

### Key Technical Insight
When implementing multi-step onboarding flows, the backend must track completion of each step separately, not just the final state. Each step should be independently verifiable to ensure users can resume their journey at the correct point.

### Testing Verification
- New users properly routed to personalization
- Existing users without personalization routed to personalization
- Existing users with personalization but no data routed to bank linking
- Existing users with both personalization and data routed to dashboard

**Key Learning:** Always consider the complete user journey state machine when implementing progressive onboarding. Track each milestone independently to enable proper resumption from any point in the flow.

## 10. Chase CSV Parser Format Issues

**Date:** January 2025

### The Problem: CSV Upload Returning 400 Error

Users were getting "CSV format not supported" errors when uploading Chase bank CSV files, despite the file being the correct format.

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue 1: CSV Parser Header Misinterpretation**
The CSV parser was configured to expect column headers, but Chase CSV files don't have headers. The parser was treating the first row of actual transaction data as headers:

```
CSV Headers detected: [
  'DEBIT',
  '07/08/2025', 
  'ORIG CO NAME:Coinbase.com...',
  '-5.00',
  'ACH_DEBIT',
  ''
]
```

**Issue 2: Data Access Pattern Mismatch**
The parser was returning objects with string keys (`'0'`, `'1'`, `'2'`) but the code was trying to access array indices (`row[0]`, `row[1]`, `row[2]`).

**Issue 3: Environment Mismatch**
Transactions were being uploaded to the development database while the frontend was reading from the staging database.

### Solutions Implemented

**1. Fixed CSV Parser Configuration:**
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
.pipe(csv({ skipLines: 1, mapHeaders: ({ header }) => header.trim() }))

// After (correct)
.pipe(csv({ headers: false }))
```

**2. Updated Data Access Pattern:**
```javascript
// Before (incorrect)
const amountValue = row[3];
const dateValue = row[1];

// After (correct)
const amountValue = row['3'];
const dateValue = row['1'];
```

**3. Fixed Environment Synchronization:**
```bash
# Start backend in staging mode to match frontend
cd backend && npm run dev:staging
```

**4. Added Comprehensive Debugging:**
- Log actual CSV row structure
- Track transaction processing count
- Validate data before database insertion

### Key Debugging Techniques

1. **CSV Structure Analysis**: Always log the actual structure of parsed CSV data
2. **Environment Verification**: Ensure frontend and backend are using the same database
3. **Data Type Inspection**: Check whether CSV parsers return arrays or objects
4. **Step-by-Step Validation**: Verify each stage of the data pipeline

### Results
- Successfully processed **1,504 transactions** from Chase CSV
- Fixed automatic routing to dashboard after CSV upload
- Eliminated 400 errors during CSV processing

### TypeScript Compilation Fix
**Issue:** Function return type mismatch
```javascript
// Before (causing compilation error)
(async (req: Request, res: Response): Promise<void> => {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
}

// After (fixed)
(async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.status(403).json({ error: 'Forbidden' });
  return;
}
```

**Key Insight:** When debugging CSV upload issues, always verify the exact structure of the parsed data and ensure environment consistency between frontend and backend.
